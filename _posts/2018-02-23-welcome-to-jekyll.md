Building lightweight sites is part of the daily routine of any junior software developer.  This talk explores the trials and tribulations of trying to build a simple website for Ruby Galaxy first in Ruby on Rails,  and then stumbling upon Jekyll, a static site generator powered by Ruby.  Most importantly, the talk will include the problems  encountered along the way, and why Jekyll was the perfect fit to build Ruby Galaxy's homepage.
